I am a 6th year **MD/PhD Student** at the **University of Toronto**, currently pursuing my PhD (Year 4) in the **Department of Computer Science** and the **Vector Institute**. I am supervised by **[Dr. Anna Goldenberg](https://goldenberglab.ca/index.html)**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and health - in particular, **how can we leverage the vast data from wearable devices to make meaningful inferences about human health?**
