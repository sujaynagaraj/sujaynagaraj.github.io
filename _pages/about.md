I am a 7th year **[MD/PhD Student](https://md.utoronto.ca/current-student-biographies#nagaraj)** at the **University of Toronto**, currently wrapping up my PhD (Year 5) in the **Department of Computer Science** and the **Vector Institute**. I am also in the midst of my clinical clerkship rotations primarily at **Unity Health Network (St. Michael's Hospital)**. 

I am supervised by **[Dr. Anna Goldenberg](https://goldenberglab.ca/index.html)**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and health - in particular, **how can we leverage the vast data from wearable devices to make meaningful inferences about human health?**
