Our work at the SickKids Critical Care Unit was recently accepted in-proceedings at **Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024**: we uncover meaningful signal buried within noise artifacts in high-frequency physiological waveform data. Rather than removing this noise, we built and deployed ML models to identify it in order to achieve a variety of important clinical tasks - stay tuned for full-paper!
